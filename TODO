- implement .lock() and .unlock() to prevent config changes from other users while the script runs
- add a function for the merge "type" true/false 
- figure out a way to just delete something on every device
- maybe implement a way to check the configuration snippets for syntax errors (maybe with https://github.com/titom73/junos-conf-checker)
