- add a function for the merge "type" true/false
- figure out a way to just delete something on every device
- maybe implement a way to check the configuration snippets for syntax errors (maybe with https://github.com/titom73/junos-conf-checker)
- replace socket.inet_aton(ip) with something that doesnt suck..
